# Color Blind Simulator 🌈

A web application that simulates how images appear to individuals with different types of color blindness. This tool is designed to promote awareness of visual accessibility and assist designers in creating inclusive content.

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload any image to see how it appears under different types of color blindness.
- **Color Blindness Simulation**:
  - Protanopia (Red-Blind)
  - Deuteranopia (Green-Blind)
  - Tritanopia (Blue-Blind)
  - Achromatopsia (Complete Color Blindness)
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Instantly apply the selected color blindness filter to the uploaded image.

## 📂 File Structure
- **HTML/CSS**: Defines the structure, layout, and styling of the web app.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the image processing logic using transformation matrices for color blindness simulation.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures responsive design and a user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling for a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality for image processing.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive design framework.
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering and modifying image data.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Upload an Image**: Use the file input to upload an image.
2. **Select Simulation Type**: Choose a color blindness type from the dropdown menu.
3. **View Results**: The app processes the image and displays the original and simulated versions side-by-side using the Canvas API and color transformation matrices.

## 🎨 Color Transformation Matrices
The app uses scientifically-derived transformation matrices to simulate various types of color blindness, ensuring accurate results. References include studies such as *Brettel et al., 1997*.

## 👨‍💻 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-blind-simulator.git
2. Open index.html in your browser to use the app.
